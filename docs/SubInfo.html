<!--This page was not required; but I really want to get the full effect of the "Submit" button, without building a website for cost, plus all the other requirements for holding sensative information.  I did originally thought about providing a local storage; but at this point of my progression as a full-stack developer and engineer, I am trying to focus more of concised and necessary markup, with HTML5; use little logic as possible, or place majority/all logic in a language like JavaScript (no/little requirement for End User to download/update machine with software or program; which could slow/hinder machine's desired performance/functionality [my opinion, at the momnet: I am open-minded]); and leave all/majority of animation with CSS3.  It is my hope and desired effefct that code is clear to the End User, Developer; and the machine and server.  I kept some original thought or intentions, in attempt to get my code to work as I desired; i.e. trying to get certain backgrounds to show.  I beleive some of my code is affecting other desired code, particurally my animations (syntax vs. symantix).-->

The average preperation for a space mission is 215 +/  (7 1/3 months, roughly); so,this child's inheritance should cause it to be last: thus, giving it the full effect desired that the end user actually decided to go into space.
